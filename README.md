# Dharma Bootstrap Theme

Dharma is a minimal-dependency, Bootstrap 5 theme for your projects.

## Development

The `dev` folder contains everything you need to build Dharma in a local dev environment. Checkout the README.md file at `dev/README.md` for instructions on getting started.

## Production

The `produciton` folder is a pre-compiled bundle that is ready to be deployed. It's using demonstration data so you'll obviously want to make some changes before using it in a real project.
