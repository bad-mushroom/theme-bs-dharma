## Builds

### Development

The `dev` folder contains everything you need to build Dharma in a local dev environment using Webpack. Checkout the [README.md](./dev/readme) file at `./dev/README.md` for instructions on getting started.

### Production

The `production` folder is a pre-compiled and minified bundle that is ready to be deployed. It's using demonstration data so you'll obviously want to make some changes before using it in a real project.
