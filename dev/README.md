# Getting Started

Dharma uses [npm](https://npmjs.org) to manage dependencies and [Webpack]('https://weboack.org') to handle our asset building and develoment environment. To get started, you'll need to have
[npm](https://npmjs.org) installed.

## dependencies

You can view a list of dependencies in the `package.json` file in the root of this directory.

Install the dependencies with:

```
npm ci
```

Once everything is installed you can run the webpack dev server with the following command.

```
npm run serve
```

Open your browser and point it at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
