# Getting Started

Dharma uses (npm)['https://npmjs.org'] to manage dependencies and (Webpack)['https://weboack.org'] to handle our develoment environment. To get started, you'll need to have
(npm)['https://npmjs.org'] already installed.

```
npm ci
```

This will install all of the needed dependencies for building Dharma locally along with Webpack.

```
npm run serve
```
